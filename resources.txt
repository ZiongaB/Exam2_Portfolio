This is a list of resources used for the EXAM 2 Project:

Images:

-These were all screenshots or photos taken by me so it should be fine.
-(Picture of the Player's Handbook is a picture of my own handbooks)


Code:

-While most of my code was built from snippets and ideas from the previous project, some a few came from w3schools.
-https://www.w3schools.com/js/tryit.asp?filename=tryjs_validation_js

-While I was able to remember some basics about flex box by looking at the code from the Metz rebuild assignment, I did look at this site to fully understand it.
-https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/

-I used this to understand how the tabindex element worked 
-https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/tabindex


Additional (non-coding) resources I used for additional polish:
